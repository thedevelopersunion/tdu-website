        The Developers Union is no longer being worked on. Brent, Jake, Loren, and Roger want to say thanks for your support. We think we did a lot of good for the indie
        developer community, but between having babies, getting married, and being busy with work, none of us have the time to dedicate to it anymore. We've deleted all user
        data. Thanks again, you're the best. ❤️
