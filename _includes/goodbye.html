        The Developers Union is no longer being worked on. Brent, Jake, Loren, and Roger want to say thanks for your support. With your help, we feel that we were 
        able to bring attention and change to the issue of trials in apps on the App Store, but between having babies, getting married, and being busy with work, none of us have the time to dedicate to it anymore. We've deleted all user
        data. Thanks again, you're the best. ❤️
