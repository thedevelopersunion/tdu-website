    <div id="letter-content">
            <p>We believe that people who create great software should be able to make a living doing it.
                So we created The Developers Union to advocate for sustainability in the App Store.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2018, together we asked Apple to publicly commit — by the tenth anniversary of the App Store this July — to allowing free trials for all apps in the App Stores before July 2019.
                After that, we planned on starting to advocate for a more reasonable revenue cut and other community-driven, developer-friendly changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Developers Union got a lot of attention in our little community, including: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-app-developers-union/?mbid=social_twitter">Wired</a>,
