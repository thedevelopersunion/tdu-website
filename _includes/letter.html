    <h1 id="greeting">Dear Apple,</h1>
    <div id="letter-content">
            <p>We believe that people who create great software should be able to make a living doing it.
                So we created The Developers Union to advocate for sustainability in the App Store.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2018, together we asked Apple to publicly commit — by the tenth anniversary of the 
                App Store this July — to allowing free trials for all apps in the App Stores before July 2019. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Developers Union contributed to small but important <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/app-developers-get-their-wish-with-expanded-support-for-free-trials/">changes</a> in the App Store that 
                allow for these trials
