        <div class="bio">
            Jake is an independent artist living in Boise, Idaho with his wife and two daughters. 
            Filling most of his time as a filmmaker and commercial director, 
            Jake claims he is no longer bitter about the Mac Pro and looks forward to returning to editing 
            on the Mac in 2019. His debut feature documentary, 
            <a class="link" href="http://appdocumentary.com">App: The Human Story</a>, chronicled the meteoric explosion of the “app” 
            as a cultural phenomenon, along with the corresponding struggle of many developers 
            dealing with the limitations of the App Store model.

            <p>
                Roger is a software developer who writes mainly for iOS for his day job.
                He got his first Mac in 2007: a white polycarbonate MacBook. Since then, he’s closely followed the Apple indie developer scene, 
                which inspired him to become a programmer. He enjoys obsessively following theme park news and reconfiguring his terminal dot files for the 37th time this year. 
                He lives in Boise with his wife Sidney and his two dogs Annabelle and Oliver, and occasionally blogs at <a class="link" href="http://relativitytransit.com">The Relativity Transit</a>.
