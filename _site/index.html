        The Developers Union is no longer active. Although we failed to scale to a size that would neccesetate Apple’s attention, 
        we feel that with your help we were able to bring attention and change to the issue of trials in apps on the App Store. 
        We've deleted all user data. Thanks again, this community is the best.

            <p>We believe that people who create great software should be able to make a living doing it.
                So we created The Developers Union to advocate for sustainability in the App Store.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2018, together we asked Apple to publicly commit — by the tenth anniversary of the 
                App Store this July — to allowing free trials for all apps in the App Stores before July 2019. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Developers Union contributed to small but important <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/app-developers-get-their-wish-with-expanded-support-for-free-trials/">changes</a> in the App Store that 
                allow for these trials

    <h1 class="heading">F.A.Q</h1>
    <p><b>Is this a union union with dues and stuff?</b></p>
    <p><i>No, this is a non-union union created to bring developers and supporters together for better App Stores for all by focusing on issues that best serve those who create and use apps.</i></p>

    <p><b>Why free trials?</b></p>
    <p>
        <i>Free trials are a great place to start and gather the momentum needed to create significant change. 
        Trials allow developers to show users their creation and establish value.
        Before iOS, Mac developers relied heavily on free trials, and they were able to make a living while making great software.
        </i>

        <b>
            What other changes will The Developers Union advocate for?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            We really want this to be community-driven, so this is about your ideas. One thing on top of developers' minds is the revenue split between Apple and developers. That could be next.

            as a cultural phenomenon, along with the corresponding struggle of many developers 
            dealing with the limitations of the App Store model.
